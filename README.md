TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
Time Series analysis is one of the core concepts in Data Science. Role of Time Series is to review the dataset and make forecast predictions for business purposes.
The dataset I worked with is "Airlines" and purpose was to see changes of count of passengers within years range.
Feel free to check output images I exported related to analysis and forecasting.
